# bank-CSharp
A simple bank project running on Console C# project

# How it works:

- The script tells you to choose one of the options (deposit, withdraw, view your balance and exit).- If you choose to deposit, choose a number (which is obviously not negative) to add to your balance.
- If you are going to withdraw, withdraw money that is less than your current balance, otherwise, it will not work.

# How to use:

- Open Visual Studio, VS Code or any other support that uses the C# language.
- Compile and run the code.
- Follow the Project Console instructions to "touch your bank".

# How faithful is this project?

- Learn how to use Switch and While, Console.Clear and money movements.
